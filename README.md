# Attendance App

## Project Description
This is an attendance management application designed for employers and employees. The app aims to provide a dynamic and automated solution for tracking attendance, with a focus on location-based check-ins for employees and comprehensive control for employers.

## Features
*   **User Authentication:** Secure login for both employers and employees.
*   **Location-Based Attendance:** Employees can only mark themselves as present when they are within a pre-defined geographical location set by the employer.
*   **Dynamic Attendance Management:** Employers have the ability to view, modify, and manage attendance records for all employees.
*   **Automated Processes:** The app will streamline attendance tracking, reducing manual effort for employers.
*   **Reporting:** (Consider adding reporting features for employers to view attendance data).

## Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** Android (Kotlin) with Jetpack Compose for a modern and reactive user interface.
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase, providing a robust and scalable backend with real-time capabilities for authentication, database, and potentially storage.
